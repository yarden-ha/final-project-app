    <p>
        The Connected Adaptive Resistance Exercise (CARE) prototype is a rehabilitation and training device designed to
        adapt resistance in real time based on user performance. It combines a Raspberry Pi, Arduino, high-torque
        stepper motor, load sensors, and an incremental encoder to monitor force, movement, and training parameters.
        This data is processed to provide precise, safe, and personalized exercise loads, especially for individuals
        with physical limitations or undergoing rehabilitation.

    <p>
        The Raspberry Pi serves as the main controller, running the interface and adaptive algorithms, while the Arduino
        manages real-time sensor readings and motor control. Using feedback from the force sensor and encoder, the
        system dynamically adjusts motor velocity according to the force applied by the user. This approach allows the
        user to control the pace of movement naturally, while the system ensures consistent resistance and accurate
        performance tracking, creating an effective and engaging rehabilitation experience.
